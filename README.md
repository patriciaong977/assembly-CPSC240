# Assembly-CPSC240
Mini Projects from CPSC 240 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language

Assignment 1: Circumference of Circle
  ###### Make a program that will:
    - compute the approximate circumference of a circule using only integers.
  
Assignment 2: Arrays
  ###### Make an assembly program that teaches the following:
    - how to make an array
    - how to implement iteration
    - how to make professional looking programs
    - how to reject invalid inputs
    - how to put on your resume: "I program in assembly for sheer enjoyment." (Debatable statement)

Assignment 3: Array Sort
  ###### Make an assembly program that teaches the following:
    - pass by pointer
    - how to read the CPU's own clock.

Assignment 4: Circumference of Circle (Exploring floating point number)
  ###### Make a program that will
    - accept as input a quadword float number representing the radius of a circle.
    - compute the area of the circle with that radius.
    - use the modern equation for the cirumference, c = 2 x pi x r
    - use the modern value for pi; look it up online. (Need to use the IEEE754 value for pi)

Assignment 5: Area of Triangle
  ###### Make a program that 
    - will input three quadword float numbers representing the sides of a triangle.
    - confirm that the inputs are valid floats.
    - compute the area of a triangle using heron's formula.
    - gain familiarity with the use of SSE (xmm) register.
    - validate incoming float numbers.
    - convert valid strings to IEEE quad numbers.
